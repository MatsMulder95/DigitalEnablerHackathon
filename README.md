# DigitalEnablerHackathon
We created a system that allows to different users that are living on a city to report different kind of issues: noisy areas, air contamination.

We have two components:
- A dashboard that shows every alert with water and air contamination.
- An application that allows to create alerts.

## Dashboard

## App
The application is made using Flutter, a cross platform mobile app development framework.
Features:
- The application allows people to signal problems in construction sites or at industrial locations that have been registerd in the system.
- The problems can for example be air quality problems or noise problems.
- It should be used by people to report any issues during production or development.
- The issues are reported to the platform where their are visualized
